# Reporting Issues

Submit a [well written issue](#what-is-a-well-written-issue) to [Github's issue tracker](./issues).
This will require a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) *(its free)*.

## What is a well written issue?

* Provide a descriptive summary
* Reference the Curate gem version in which you encountered the problem
* Explain the expected behavior
* Explain the actual behavior
* Provide steps to reproduce the actual behavior

# Git Flow Branching Strategy

Curate uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as its branching procedure.
We acknowledge that this adds additional complexities to the branching process.
It is our belief that the project's code health is better for these complexities.

## Why Git Flow?

The **master** branch should **always be deployable**…
And therefore anyone cloning the Curate repository will have a vetted version of Curate to work against.

**Urgent fixes** should be quick to apply…
And therefore anyone that has adopted Curate can quickly apply those fixes.

**Completed features** should be released as one unit…
And therefore an adopter does not see portions of an incomplete feature in their latest point release.

The git-flow process **is a well defined procedure**…
And therefore anyone contributing to the project can reference excellent 3rd party resources on the procedure.

The git-flow process **is encoded in a [Git extension](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)**…
And therefore anyone contributing to the project can use the plugin to adhear to the branching procedure.

And best of all, **we don't have to write our own procedure** that would require additional vetting.
